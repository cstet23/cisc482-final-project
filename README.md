# Alarm App with Mini Games
## Project Description

The Alarm App with Mini Games is designed to help students wake up in an engaging and effective way. Unlike traditional alarms that can be easily snoozed, our app makes waking up a bit more of a challenge, incorporating fun mini-games that need to be completed before the alarm turns off. The goal is to get users more alert and ready to start their day.

This app is particularly useful for students who struggle with waking up on time or have a habit of turning off their alarm without getting out of bed. The mini-games are aimed at stimulating the mind and making users actively participate, thereby reducing the likelihood of oversleeping.

## Features

1- **Custom Alarms**: Set multiple alarms with options for time, label, and repeat days.

2- **Mini Games** to Dismiss Alarm: Choose from a selection of mini-games that need to be completed before the alarm can be turned off. The games are designed to be fun but also challenging enough to get the brain active in the morning.
  *  Puzzle Solver: Solve a basic puzzle to dismiss the alarm.
  *  Math Challenges: Answer a few simple math questions to disable the alarm.

## Technology Stack

* **Android SDK** for mobile app development.

* **Java** for the core application logic.

* **XML** for UI layout design.

* **SQLite** for saving alarm configurations.

## How to Use

1- **Set an Alarm**: Use the "Set Alarm" page to choose the time and day(s) for your alarm.

2- **Mini Game Selection**: Select the mini-game you prefer to solve in order to disable the alarm.

3- **Save and Manage**: Save the new alarm settings and see the alarm listed on the main page with an easy on/off toggle.

4- **Waking Up**: When the alarm rings, solve the selected mini-game to turn it off.
